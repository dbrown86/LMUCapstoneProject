Run these commands in PowerShell to manually verify Phase 0:

# 1. Check current branch
$env:GIT_PAGER = ''; git branch --show-current

# 2. Check if backup branch exists
$env:GIT_PAGER = ''; git branch | Select-String "dashboard-refactor-backup"

# 3. Check if feature branch exists
$env:GIT_PAGER = ''; git branch | Select-String "feature/dashboard-refactor"

# 4. Check for physical backup
Get-ChildItem -Directory -Filter "dashboard_backup_*"

# 5. Check recent commits
$env:GIT_PAGER = ''; git log --oneline -5 | Select-Object -First 5

Expected results:
- Current branch: Should be "feature/dashboard-refactor" or your base branch
- Backup branch: Should show "dashboard-refactor-backup"
- Feature branch: Should show "feature/dashboard-refactor"
- Physical backup: Should show a folder like "dashboard_backup_20241215"
- Recent commits: Should include "Save working dashboard before refactoring"
